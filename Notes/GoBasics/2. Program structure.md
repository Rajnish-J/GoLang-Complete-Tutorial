# Notes: Structure of a Go Program

## Overview

Before diving into the basic building blocks of the Go programming language, it's essential to understand the **bare minimum structure** of a Go program. This will serve as a reference in subsequent chapters.

A typical Go program consists of the following parts:

- Package Declaration
- Import Packages
- Functions
- Variables
- Statements and Expressions
- Comments

## Example: Hello World Program

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
   /* This is my first sample program. */
   fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

## Explanation of Code Parts

### 1. Package Declaration

```go
package main
```

* Defines the package name.
* Mandatory in all Go programs.
* `main` package indicates the starting point of the program.

### 2. Import Packages

```go
import "fmt"
```

* Used to include other packages.
* `"fmt"` is a standard package for formatted I/O operations.

### 3. Main Function

```go
func main() { ... }
```

* The entry point for program execution.
* Every executable Go program must contain a `main()` function in the `main` package.

### 4. Comments

```go
/* Multi-line comment */
// Single-line comment
```

* Used to annotate the code.
* Ignored by the compiler.
* Can be written using `/*...*/` or `//`.

### 5. Print Statement

```go
fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
```

* Prints a message to the console.
* `Println` is an **exported function** from the `fmt` package.
* Functions or variables that start with a **capital letter** are exported and accessible from other packages.

## Executing a Go Program

### Steps:

1. Open a text editor and paste the code.
2. Save the file as `hello.go`.
3. Open a terminal/command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where `hello.go` is saved.
5. Run the command:

```sh
go run hello.go
```

### Output:

```sh
Hello, World!
```
