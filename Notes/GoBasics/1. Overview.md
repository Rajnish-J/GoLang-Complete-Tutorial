# ðŸ“˜ Go Language Notes

## ðŸ§¾ What is Go Language?

**Go** (also known as **Golang**) is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed for efficiency and simplicity, particularly in **systems programming** and **concurrent application development**.

- **Created by**: Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson at Google
- **Started in**: 2007
- **Announced in**: November 2009
- **Used by**: Google and other large-scale systems

Go provides:
- Fast compilation
- Built-in garbage collection
- Strong concurrency support

## ðŸ“¦ Key Concepts

### âœ… General Purpose and Statistically Typed
Go is suitable for building a wide range of applications and enforces static typing to reduce bugs and improve performance.

### âœ… Packages
Go organizes code using **packages**, enabling modular programming and effective **dependency management**.

### âœ… Compiled Language
Go uses a **traditional compile and link model** to create **native executable binaries**.

## ðŸš€ Features of Go Programming

### 1. **Dynamic Language Feel**
- Example: `x := 0` infers `x` as `int` without explicit type declaration.
- Encourages cleaner and faster development.

### 2. **Fast Compilation**
- Go compiles to machine code quickly, which accelerates development.

### 3. **Built-in Concurrency**
- Go provides **goroutines** and **channels** for concurrent programming.
- Enables efficient multi-core utilization.

### 4. **Simplicity and Safety**
- Syntax is concise and easy to read.
- Avoids complex constructs to reduce errors.

### 5. **Interfaces and Type Embedding**
- Go supports **interface-based programming** and **composition over inheritance** through type embedding.

### 6. **Native Executables**
- Go produces statically linked binaries with **no external dependencies**.

## ðŸš« Features Excluded (Intentionally)

To keep Go minimal and maintainable, the following features are **not supported**:

| Feature                            | Reason |
|------------------------------------|--------|
| Type inheritance                   | Promotes composition over inheritance |
| Method or operator overloading     | Keeps language simple and predictable |
| Circular dependencies among packages | Prevents complexity and maintenance issues |
| Pointer arithmetic                 | Ensures memory safety |
| Assertions                         | Replaced by explicit error handling |
| Generic programming (Until Go 1.18) | Initially omitted for simplicity (added later) |

## ðŸ“‚ Go Programs

### File Format
- Go source files end with `.go`
- Can be written using editors like `vim`, `VS Code`, or `GoLand`

### Program Structure
A basic Go program has:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
